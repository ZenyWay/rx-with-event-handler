# rx-with-event-handler
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/rx-with-event-handler.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/rx-with-event-handler/)

[`RxJS`](http//reactivex.io/rxjs/) operator for lifting a [`component-from-stream`](https://npmjs.com/package/component-from-stream/)
that wraps [`rx-with-event-handler-props`](https://npmjs.com/package/rx-with-event-handler-props/),
adding an `onEvent` event handling operator (and an optional `orElse` operator).
shorthand for:
```ts
compose(
  when(hasEvent(id))(onEvent, orElse),
  withEventHandlerProps(id)
)
```
for a usage example, see the [`component-from-stream`](https://npmjs.com/package/component-from-stream/) module.

for more information, see the [`rx-with-event-handler-props`](https://npmjs.com/package/rx-with-event-handler-props/),
[`rx-when`](https://npmjs.com/package/rx-when/)
and [`basic-compose`](https://npmjs.com/package/basic-compose/) modules.

# API
```ts
declare function withEventHandler<E>( id: string): {
  (): EventHandlerPropsOperator<E, EventProp<E>> // = withEventHandlerProps(id)

  <I, O = I & EventHandlerProp<E> & Partial<EventProp<E>>>(
    onEvent: RxOperator<I & EventHandlerProp<E> & Partial<EventProp<E>>, O>,
    orElse?: RxOperator<I & EventHandlerProp<E>, O>
  ): RxOperator<I, O>
}

type RxOperator<I,O> = ($: Observable<I>) => Observable<O>
```
when the returned function is called without handlers (no argument),
it simply passes the given event `id` string through to `withEventHandlerProps`
from [`rx-with-event-handler-props`](https://npmjs.com/package/rx-with-event-handler-props/),
i.e. the following are equivalent:
```ts
import withEventHandler from 'rx-with-event-handler'
// import withEventHandlerProps from 'rx-with-event-handler-props'

withEventHandler('click')() // = withEventHandlerProps('click')
```

for convenience, this module exports the `hasEvent`, `hasEventHandler` and
`toHandlerKey` helpers from [`rx-with-event-handler-props`](https://github.com/ZenyWay/rx-with-event-handler-props#type-definitions).

# TypeScript
although this library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
it may also be imported into plain JavaScript code:
modern code editors will still benefit from the available type definition,
e.g. for helpful code completion.
